On sign in page we see the "sorry wrong answer" so we investigate.

We see the "username" and "password" in the URL of the page in GET method.
So we tried to bruteforce the password with the List of the most common password finded here : 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords

We tried with severals years and finally the 2014 contains the password shadow, and we get the flag. 

You can see a little php script that we used to find it.
